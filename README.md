Hi, I'm Filip, also known as filyys, I'm a front-end developer from Poland. I mainly work with React, NextJS, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and databases like SQLite & MySQL.

#### 🌿 Why this, why me and why here?

From the start of my journey, a couple years ago, learning to build Discord bots in Python, then learning about databases and getting into web development, I've come a small way. It definitely isn't impressive, it isn't special, nor is it talent. Consistency is incredibly important with many things. This account isn't made as means to impress others, it's a journal for myself to keep and to look back, months later at what I've learnt.
